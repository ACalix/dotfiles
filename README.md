# Installation
```
./setup
```

---

**NOTE:**
For convenience, the setup script sources an optional `POST-INSTALL.sh` script after install. This is a place where device specific configuations can be added.

An example might be:
```
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --global user.email "jane.doe@mailinator.com"
```

# Homebrew/Linuxbrew Setup
```
./brew
```

__Enjoy!__
