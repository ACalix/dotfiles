# Installation
```
./setup
```

---

**NOTE:**
For convenience, the setup script sources an optional `POST-INSTALL.sh` script after install. This is a place where device specific configuations can be added.

An example might be:
```
git config --user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --user-email "jane.doe@mailinator.com"
```

# Homebrew/Linuxbrew Setup
```
./brew
```

------
__Enjoy!__
